# üöÄ EDEN3 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

## ‚úÖ Academy Deployed to Vercel!

**Production URL**: https://academy-5sshx9fhz-edenprojects.vercel.app

Your Academy frontend is now LIVE on Vercel! However, it needs the API to function properly.

## üî¥ ACTION REQUIRED: Deploy API to Railway

Since Railway requires interactive login, please follow these steps in your terminal:

### Step 1: Login to Railway
```bash
cd /Users/seth/eden3/apps/api
railway login
```
This will open your browser to login to Railway.

### Step 2: Create New Project
```bash
railway new
```
Choose a name like "eden3-api" when prompted.

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL
```bash
railway add
```
Select "PostgreSQL" from the list. Railway will provision a database and show you the connection string.

### Step 4: Add Redis
```bash
railway add
```
Select "Redis" from the list. Railway will provision Redis and show you the connection URL.

### Step 5: Set Environment Variables
Go to your Railway dashboard (https://railway.app) and add these environment variables to your project:

```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=[Copy from Railway PostgreSQL]
REDIS_URL=[Copy from Railway Redis]
JWT_SECRET=your-production-jwt-secret-64-chars-recommended
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-production-encryption-key-32-chars
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://academy-5sshx9fhz-edenprojects.vercel.app
API_PORT=3001
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Step 6: Deploy the API
```bash
railway up
```

### Step 7: Get Your API URL
After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://eden3-api-production.up.railway.app`

## üîÑ UPDATE VERCEL WITH API URL

Once you have your Railway API URL, update Vercel:

```bash
cd /Users/seth/eden3/apps/academy

# Remove old environment variable
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production

# Add new one with your Railway URL
echo "https://your-api.railway.app" | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production

# Redeploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## üìã Final Checklist

After both are deployed:

1. **Test API Health**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-api.railway.app/health
   ```

2. **Test Academy**:
   - Visit: https://academy-5sshx9fhz-edenprojects.vercel.app
   - Check that agents load on homepage
   - Navigate to /showcase for live activity
   - Check /observatory for agent status

3. **Verify Content Generation**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-api.railway.app/api/agents
   ```

## üéâ Your Live URLs Will Be:

- **Academy (LIVE NOW)**: https://academy-5sshx9fhz-edenprojects.vercel.app
- **API (After Railway)**: https://eden3-api-production.up.railway.app

## üìù Notes

- Academy is deployed and waiting for the API
- All production files are ready (.env.production, etc.)
- The system will auto-generate content once the API is running
- 10 AI agents will start creating content immediately

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs`
3. Ensure DATABASE_URL is set correctly in Railway
4. Verify CORS settings include your Vercel domain
